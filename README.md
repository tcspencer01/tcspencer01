## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub page! Here, I'll highlight some example code to demonstrate my abilities with R, Python, Bash, and common bioinformatics tools. Please note that input files are not provided at this time because this work is in preparation for publication, and some sensitive information (specific genes, tissues, and cell types identified by the analysis) has been photoshopped out of the provided example plots.

I tend to use a combination of languages/tools to analyze and plot massive amounts of data with reasonable runtime. Take a look at my "Bulk/snRNA-seq Manhattan Plot" repository to see how I used a combination of Bash and R to plot >100GB worth of quantitative trait loci (QTL) data all in one plot, shown below:

(Gene names were replaced with Transformer names to protect my forthcoming publication.)

In bioinformatics, it's also important to understand toolkits like BEDtools, which have lightning-fast runtimes that save you hours of wait. To see how I used a combination of Bash, BEDtools, and R to plot ADD IN, look at the repository "ADD IN." That's how I made this plot:

(Tissue / cell type names replaced with Starfleet ships to protect my forthcoming publication.)

And finally, Python! Those defaultdicts are a phenomenal way to speed up complex analyses. Take a look at "ADD IN" to see how I quantified RNA editing of Alu regions in hundreds of BAM files using Python and samtools.

I've also included some of my prettiest-looking plots below as further samples of my work:

Thanks for reading!
